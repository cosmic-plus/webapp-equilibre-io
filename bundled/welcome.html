<section><h2>February, 16th âˆ’ Beta 1 Release</h2>
  <section><h3>Welcome!</h3>

    <p>Equilibre.io is a portfolio balancer that runs on the Stellar
    Decentralized Exchange. It is a convenient trading tool to manage long-term
    positions.</p>

    <p>Regularly balancing an investment portfolio is known to boost its
    performances, providing you choose wisely the assets to bet on. Equilibre.io
    also lets you spread your positions over several anchors, for better fund
    safety.</p>

    <p>Equilibre.io is still under testing & development. If you use it now,
    I'll ask you to consider yourself as a tester. Please report any bug you
    could encounter, and double-check transactions before signing them.</p>

    <p>Your feedback matters to me and will be listened to.</p>

    <p>Respectfully, <br>MisterTicot</p>
