  <h2>What is Equilibre.io?</h2>

    <h3>A Portfolio Balancer for Stellar</h3>

    <div><img src="./images/repartition.png" alt="">

    <p>
      Equilibre.io is a portfolio balancer for Stellar. In other words, it is
      a software which helps you to spread your funds across various
      currencies and crypto assets.
    </p>

    <p>
      I initially created it to protect my funds against a possible bear market.
      As it proved reliable, I decided to make it publicly available.
    </p>

    <p>
      Equilibre.io is merely a sophisticated front-end for the Stellar
      Decentralized exchange: your account, holdings & operations live on the
      blockchain.
    </p>

    <p>
      It works a bit like a multi-currency bank account. Except there's no bank.
      And you are the only one in control.

    <h3>A Risk Management Solution</h3>

    <div><img src="./images/history.png" alt="">
    <p>
      Equilibre.io can help you to implement what is known as a "balanced
      investment strategy". Basically, the idea is that balancing funds over
      multiple assets will average a portfolio performance & mitigate the risks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's how it works: we choose a number of assets we want to be exposed
      to, and we attribute a share of the portfolio to each of them (e.g: 20%
      each). Then, we "rebalance" the portfolio on a regular basis. This means
      that we pass trades that bring back each asset to its allocated share.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is important to understand that Equilibre.io is not an automated
      trading bot, nor a magic-free-money scheme. It is a product made for
      people who can decide on their own strategy & who understand the risks
      they are taking.

    <h3>A Fancy Account Viewer</h3>

    <div><img src="./images/balances.png" alt="">
    <p>
      Equilibre.io offers a live view of the latest blockchain state. It is also
      in sync with the latest market data & displays values and historical data
      in your national currency.
    <p>

    <p>
      It is one of the few applications (if not the only one) that can retrieves
      the complete history of any Stellar account, and pack that data into a
      fancy chart.

    <h3>A Sophisticated Trading Engine</h3>


    <div><img src="./images/activity.png" alt="">
    <p>
      Equilibre.io is, first of all, a collection of fine-tuned trading
      algorithms.  Since a year, I've crash-tested them in every way I could
      imagine and packed what worked the best in an easy-to-use interface.
    <p>

    <p>
      It can transform templates such as "I want 50% of my portfolio in BTC and
      50% in XLM" into a transaction that passes the required orders. Forget
      about trust lines, order books and price picking: all that stuff is dealt
      with in the background.
    <p>

    <p>
      The trading engine has a defensive behavior: it prioritizes not losing
      money over taking risks to make a profit.

    <h3>A New Security Standard for the Years to Come</h3>

    <div><img src="./images/side-frame.png" alt="">
    <p>
      Equilibre.io strictly enforce cryptography good practices: I certainly
      don't want to know about your private key, nor to obtain any kind of
      control over your account. <em>“Who can protect a house full of gold and
      jewels?”</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      When you want to rebalance your portfolio, Equilibre.io generates a
      transaction request that you can sign using your own wallet. This is
      possible thanks to protocols known as CosmicLink & SEP-0007.
    </p>

    <p>
      Those protocols turn any compatible Stellar wallet into something like
      Metamask for Ethereum. At that time, only a few services are compatibles.
      However, a number of wallets announced their intention to support
      transactions requests in the future, including Keybase, Lobster, and
      Stargazer.

    <h3>A Free Software, as in Freedom</h3>

    <div>
    <p>
      I think that the free software cooperative mindset can go a long way in
      improving a project such as Stellar. That's why I released Equilibre.io in
      the public domain. Here are some of the benefits of it:
    </p>

    <p>
      Auditability: The software can be proven to contain no malware and no
      tracker. It can be audited for flaws & proven safe.
    </p>

    <p>
      Forkability: Any feature implemented by the software becomes <em>de
      facto</em> available to every other developer. For example, the code I
      wrote to support Ledger Wallets is <a
      href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cosmic-plus/ledger-wallet"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">freely available to all</a>.
