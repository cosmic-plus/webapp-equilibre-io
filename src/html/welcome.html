  <section><h3>Welcome!</h3>

    <p>Equiliber.io is a portfolio balancer that runs on the Stellar
    Decentralized Exchange. It is a convenient trading tool to manage positions
    over the long term.</p>

    <p>Regularly balancing an investment portfolio is known to boost its
    performances, providing you choose wisely the assets to bet on. Equilibre.io
    also let you spread your position over several anchors, for a better fund
    safety.</p>

    <p>Equilibre.io is still under testing & development. If you use it now,
    I'll ask you to consider yourself as a tester. Please report any bug you
    could encounter, and double-check transactions before signing them.</p>

    <p>Your feedback matters to me and will be listened to.</p>

    <p>Respectfully, <br>MisterTicot</p>
